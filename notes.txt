Working with the W65C265SXB development board on a Mac

I attempted to attach to the device with screen using:
 screen /dev/tty.usbserial-A10LVXT6 960
It seems to be listening to the device just fine. When I press 'reset' on the board, I get a dump of text but screen doesn't newline it
and the output keeps overwriting itself. I think the board is only sending CRs and no NLs.

I tried to use picocom instead to confirm my suspicions:
 picocom /dev/tty.usbserial-A10LVXT6 --baud 9600 --imap spchex,tabhex,crhex,lfhex

This command ensures that spc,tab,cr, and lf characters are sent as their hex strings. This worked and confirmed that the device was only sending carraige returns:

"0D" is the character for carraige returns. There should be a way to get picocom to insert a LF character for us.

I couldn't find a way to do this in Picocom :(. I have another terminal emualtor tool call "Serial" (which isn't free) that has an option for this buried in settings "Interpret Standalone CR as CRLF". This did the trick.

The included monitor ROM has tools to read registers and rw to memory. I'm going to try to flip some bits to make one of the LEDs turn on.
